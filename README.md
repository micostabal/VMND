# VMND
A Python Implementation of the Variable MIP Neighborhood Descent Heuristic. This work is based on [Larra√≠n et al 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cor.2017.03.010). This MIP heuristic is implemented in Gurobipy and can significantly reduce gap in many routing and integer problems. Four routing-type problems are already implemented in which the best perfomances can be made, nevertheless this library can be used eventually for any MIP!
