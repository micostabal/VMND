# VMND
A Python Implementation of the Variable MIP Neighborhood Descent Heuristic. This repository is based on the work of [Larrain et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cor.2017.03.010). This MIP heuristic is implemented in Gurobipy and can significantly improve performance in many routing and integer problems. Several Routing-type problems have been implemented here, nevertheless this library and method can be used for virtually every MIP!
