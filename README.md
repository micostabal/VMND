# VMND
A Python Implementation of the Variable MIP Neighborhood Descent Heuristic. This work is based on [Larrain et al 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cor.2017.03.010). This MIP heuristic is implemented in Gurobipy and can significantly reduce gap in many routing and integer problems. Routing-type problems are those in which the best performances have been already achieved and several have been implemented here, nevertheless this library and method can be used for any MIP!
